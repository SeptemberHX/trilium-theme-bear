# Trilium-Bear for Trilium

A custom Trilium theme inspired by the Bear note-taking app.

You may want to adjust the .note-detail-text-editor width to match your display size. The extra padding-right and particularly -left for .note-detail-text is for handling distraction-free (Zen) mode (alt-M).

Icons from https://boxicons.com/.
